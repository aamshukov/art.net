Hi Guys,
I experimented with Angular over the weekend to get a feel for it.
I set up a simple project on my computer (a couple of components in a single module),
and the installation process seemed much more straightforward compared to the setup on BBB machines (I managed to install only nodejs on BBB side).

By the way, Microsoft introduced a great package for using Blazor in WinForms: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.WindowsForms.
I played with a sample from Microsoft and it much faster compare to nodejs/Angular stuff.
Why not consider using that?
It's a native C#/.NET component, making it easier to install, maintain, and work with.
It also comes with a solid UI library, and since it's packaged with CC (nuget), you donâ€™t need to spawn Node.js and Angular/ng processes.
Less installation, maintanance and unknown dependences ...
